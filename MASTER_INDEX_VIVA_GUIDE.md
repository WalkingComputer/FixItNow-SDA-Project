## ?? **KEY TALKING POINTS**

### **Factory Pattern:**
*"I implemented Factory Method Pattern for notifications. Instead of hardcoding notification creation logic throughout the application, I created a NotificationFactory that creates the appropriate notification type (Email, SMS, or In-App) based on a parameter. This follows the Open/Closed Principle and makes it easy to add new notification types without modifying existing code."*

### **Rating System:**
*"The new rating system allows residents to select their preferred technician based on ratings instead of waiting for admin assignment. After ticket completion, residents rate technicians 1-5 stars. This creates healthy competition among technicians to maintain high ratings, which incentivizes quality work. Admin uses these ratings for data-driven hiring decisions."*

### **Architecture:**
*"I implemented 14 industry-standard design patterns organized in 4 layers - Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation. This separation of concerns makes the code maintainable, testable, and scalable. All components follow SOLID principles and use dependency injection for loose coupling."*
